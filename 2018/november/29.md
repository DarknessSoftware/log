There and back again, right? I'll try again to keep this log updated. 

Yesterday was my last day on Red Ventures where I - hopefully - left a good legacy behind, so right now I have a lot of mixed feelings, from anguish to anxiety to a kind of happiness. I will start in a exciting brand new job in a few days. Looking forward to share all the things I'll learn on this new adventure.

Today I've read two amazing articles, which I'm sharing on the links section below, one about a really simple solution to a complex problem or why it's important to gatter some data before making decisions and the other one with a proposition to save our democracy using technology.
