Today I heard something from one of the best designers on my team that really got me thinking the rest of the day, he said: "People are afraid of you because you always tell them the truth they don't want to hear". This is something crazy for me because one of the things I miss the most on virtually everyone is sincerity. Bringing it to our world, always treat your teammates with sincerity and don't be afraid of the ones willing to tell you the truth, usally they are the ones you can trust blindly.
