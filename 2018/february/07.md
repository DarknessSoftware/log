How often do you catch yourself "fine-tuning" a code you've been working? How often do you spend some time looking at the details of the interfaces you implement to make them look better? You may don't think this isn't important but this is what can make you stand out among other devs. (It's a big plus if you want to work at Red Ventures :stuck_out_tongue:)

## Javascript

I really like JS. It's my favorite programming language and the main reason I'm still a frontend developer (to be true I feel really bored writing CSS nowadays), so I'm always trying to find great sources of content, authors who write advanced and meaningful content about how the language works and not just tutorials about how to use some methods and/or properties. 

If you enjoy this kind of content I recommend you [Perfection Kills](http://perfectionkills.com/). You may find some great and hiper detailed posts about some stuff nobody pays atention like `delete` or `innerText`

There's also a lot of other great blogs out there like the posts from Eric Elliott or Dr. Axel Rauschmayer, mandatory reads for every Javascript developer
