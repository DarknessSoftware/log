Why do people still believes in conspiracy theories? I think it's because this is something that makes them feel smarter and the funny part of it is that it is exactly the inverse. There isn't any company hiding the cure for AIDS or a hydrogen combustion engine, this is not how the system works. Think about it: if we had a viable way to make cars fueled only by water don't you think Elon Musk, a master of disruptive technology and social changes, would have done it already? I'm pretty sure you can find another way to seem smarter, there's a lot of true knowledge waiting for you outside the conspiracies created by your imagination. 

## JS

Do you know there's a really simple way to obtain a DOMStringMap of data attributes on HTML elements? Well, until today I didn't knew this too hahaha 

```
<div id="car" data-name="Ferrari" data-year="2018"></div>

let car = document.querySelector('#car');

console.log(car.dataset) // DOMStringMap {name: "Ferrari", year: "2018"}
```

You can use the `dataset` property to add new properties programatically or to return specific properties too!

## Leadership

If your team has someone who usually stays quiet on meetings and discussions donâ€™t single them out. Find time to talk with them alone, I'm pretty sure they have a lot to contribute! So write down the best points, and in the future, direct team discussions to their points and let them stand out!
