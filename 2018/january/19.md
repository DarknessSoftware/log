Back again! This week was really tough, we had a subway strike yesterday and if you live in SÃ£o Paulo - SP (Brazil) you know the word chaos was probably invented by a "paulistano" in the first subway strike. 

Beside this, there's a lot of great things happening! At work we are restructuring our frontend team model by letting people put more focus on things they really like to do. One of the things we belive the most is to let people evolve their strengths! Not to mention that by having a multidisciplinary team we can finally move forward on a lot of ideas we had!

## Note to myself

To avoid text flashing when using fontFaceObservers I should really avoid use font-weight's different from the ones the font I'm using really have. Like, why the fuck I'm using `font-weight: 200;` if I'm downloading a font with a weight of 300? :sweat_smile:

## Leadership

- Always remember that every discussion turns emotional after the first line of code is written.
- There's no magical solutions to a problem. There's only true solutions!
