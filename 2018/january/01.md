I'm trying to learn more about soft skills and more about me to be a better person to ones around me, this includes learn how to be a better teamplayer, a better friend, a better son and a better fiance-soon-to-be-husband.

Today I focused on leadership so I spent part of my day reading a book called **The Hard thing about hard things** and the author (Ben Horowitz) has an interesting vision about giving feedback: always give *authentic* feedback, avoid something that he calls *shit sandwich*, which means wrapping criticism between compliments. Show your team you really care about their success and they will succeed.
