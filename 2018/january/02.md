First work day of the year, not so much to do at office right now so I got some free time to study and learn new things.

## JS

Writing more semantic and maintainable code is often a challenge on a ever growing codebase. Today I discovered that using named parameters I can make my life (and the life of my team) easier:

```
const setSomethingRegularWay = (hasDate, hasName) => {
  // code
}

const setSomethingNewWay = ({ hasDate, hasName }) => {
  // code
}

// The old way, what is true?
setSomethingRegularWay(true, true)

// The "new" way, now I know what true means
setSomethingNewWay({ hasDate: true, hasName: true })
```

## Reading

The "I" is an illusion as is nations, gods and money

Ensure political rights for the people increases their motivation and initiative which is useful in battlefields and factories

- Humans will lost their economic and military value
- System will continue to value humans collectively
- System will continue to value some individual humans beings creating a new superhuman elite

Will the elites and governments continue to value every human being even when he stops generating economic value? 

Computers aren't, in 2016, more conscious than their prototipes from the 1950 decade but humans still are in danger to lose their value because intelligence is decoupling from consciousness
