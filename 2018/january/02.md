First work day of the year, not so much to do at office right now so I got some free time to study and learn new things.

## JS

Writing more semantic and maintainable code is often a challenge on a evergrowing codebase. Today I discovered that using named parameters I can make my life (and the life of my team) easier:

```
const setSomethingRegularWay = (hasDate, hasName) => {
  // code
}

const setSomethingNewWay = ({ hasDate, hasName }) => {
  // code
}

// The old way, what is true?
setSomethingRegularWay(true, true)

// The "new" way, now I know what true means
setSomethingNewWay({ hasDate: true, hasName: true })
```
