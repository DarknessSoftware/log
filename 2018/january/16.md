So it's been already five days since my last log! I've been pretty busy on the last few days, a lot of things to do at work, some family stuff and my birthday yesterday basically took all my free time. I'm writing a really nice post on Medium and I planning to release it on next weekend!

The best part of work in a inspiring environment is that you don't need to actually search for reasons to learn new things, the people around you will give you enough reasons to keep going forward. It's on you to inspire the ones around you!

A good way to deal with multiple requests is using `Array Destructuring`

```
const [messages, users, products] = await Promise.all([
  fetch('/messages'),
  fetch('/users'),
  fetch('/products')
])
```
