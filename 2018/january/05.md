Today I had a great lunch with [@lfeh](https://github.com/LFeh) and some of my RV buddies, it's incredible how easy it's to have great conversations with this guy! Sometimes we talk about code, sometimes we talk about investiments, sometimes we talk about life and today we spoke about the future of technology and our role as developers in the future society.

We often don't spend enought time thinking about how much value has all the data about us we offer to companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. These companies are using this data to gain control on every aspect of our lifes, they know when we are sick, they know all about our routines, they know our political preferences and they can manipulate us to do whatever they want us to do, because we already trust these companies a lot of important decisions we used to take. We let Waze decide the best way home, we buy books from a list of recomendations built by a Amazon bot, we lock ourselves in a bubble created by Facebook while we share our privacy at Instagram. We are the ones creating these tools and I don't know if this is something we should be proud of.
