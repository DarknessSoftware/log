Are we alone in the universe? Well, judging by the estimated number of galaxies, stars and planets it's really unlikely that we are the only advanced civilization in the entire universe. But, even with high probability estimates, we still haven't found and real evidence of live in other planets. This is the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox), which hasn't been solved yet. 

The truth is that our generation has born too late to explore the earth and too early to explore the universe.

## JS - Spread operator

Spread operator is one of my favorite things on ES6 features. Today I learned how I can use it to call a function with a given set of parameters held by an array without using `Function.prototype.apply`, look at this: 

```
function getContent(a, b, c) {
	// code
}

const arr = [1, 2, 3]

// Without spread operator
getContent.apply(null, args)

// With the wonderful spread operator
getContent(...args)
```

It may seems like no big deal at first but can help you avoid writing a lot of extra code which is always a good thing
