The last few days were amazing at Red Ventures. We had a lot of great discussions about some stuff we are working right now and I'm pretty excited about the things and the culture we are building. I always try to challenge my teammates, sometimes with crazy ideas, sometimes by being the only one with a different opinion or solution for a problem we may be facing. Why I do this? Because I know these guys are awesome and their firepower has no limits. If I push them harder they will go far beyond excelence in their works!

## Stylus

Today, after a few years without needing using a "Bootstrap-like" grid system I spent literally 4 minutes to build a Stylus function to generate a grid system for me with a 'little' help of Lost. I didn't had time to think if this approach has any drawbacks.

```
grid-creator(columns, screen-size = '', gutter = '20px')
	for i in 1..columns
		if (size != '')
			.col-{size}-{i}
				lost-column i/columns auto gutter
		else
			.col-{i}
				lost-column i/columns auto gutter
```

So you can use it this way:

```
grid-creator(12, 'sm')
```
