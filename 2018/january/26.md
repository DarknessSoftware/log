In the last few days I've been seen some people on Twitter arguing that it's wrong to work hard or to dedicate the biggest part of your time and attention to the company you work for.

My first reaction, for sure was a enormous need to answer these people questioning them if they had real arguments beside the political shit and/or prejudice but I'm don't have enough patience for discussions on Twitter anymore. 

If I write here all the reasons why I think these people are wrong this daily log will turn out to be as long as a blog post but, here's a few thigs you should think about when you see someone saying this kind of shit: 

- Not every "famous" person in the frontend communit is a good developer. This applys to speakers too.
- Mostly of these people behave in a defensive way when dealing with their employers.
- Mostly of these people think their employers are in debt with them because the company they work makes a lot of money. 
- There's no shortcut to success, only hard work.
- There's no perfect company but it doesn't matter where you work there is always a way to learn.
- It doesn't matter the circunstances: always do the best you can for the company you work.
- Last but not least: do not listen to everything the "community heroes" says on Twitter.

## JS

A small JS hack to know if the user has opened the browser console

```
const addConsoleOpenListener = () => {
  let devtools = /./;
  devtools.toString = function() {
    this.opened = true;
    this.wasOpened = false;
  }

  console.log(devtools) // Do not remove this log

  setInterval(() => {
    if (devtools.opened && !devtools.wasOpened) {
      devtools.opened = false;
      devtools.wasOpened = true;
      handleConsoleOpen();
    } else if (!devtools.wasOpened) {
      devtools.wasOpened = false;
    }
  }, 1000)
}
```

## Music

This week, Slayer, one of the most important Heavy Metal bands of all time announced their last world tour one of the saddest news on the musical esphere I heard in past few years. Here are some of my favorite song of the Gods of Thrash Metal :metal:
