# Dailylog

A few months ago I was in Charlotte for Red Ventures Culture Fest and I had the chance to learn more about [Maya Angelou](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou), one of the most important writers in history and one of her quotes got stuck on my mind for quite a few days:

> When you learn, teach. When you get, give

So I decided that on the next year (2018) I would find ways to share knowledge even in simple forms, like this dailylog or creating, at least, a post a month on Medium with consistent technical stuff.

Feel free to navigate through the content, you may find some personal opinions about politics, religion and other stuff that usually causes some butt hurt, But I believe developers shouldn't live in a cocoon, writing better code isn't just about, well... code itself, every line of code you write carries your experiences, ethic and culture.

So long and may the force be with you!
